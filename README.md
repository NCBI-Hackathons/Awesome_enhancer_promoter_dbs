# Awesome_enhancer_promoter_dbs
A semi-curated list of enhancer and promoter databases.  If you know of others, please put them in issues!

## Enhancer dbs

#### Big dbs
• RefSeq Functional Elements enhancer features, experimental validation

• VISTA enhancers, experimental validation for positives

• FANTOM5 enhancers, a subset are validated

• ENCODE predicted enhancers, a subset are validated

#### Others (all epigenomic predictions):
• Ensembl Regulatory Build enhancer features

• Roadmap Epigenomics (some overlap with ENCODE)

• GeneHancer

#### Smaller dbs


#### Additional resources

* ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/snp/.ASHG2018 has a curated list of SNPs in enhancers (ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/snp/.ASHG2018/rs_RefSeq_curated_enhancer_GRCh38.vcf.gz)

## Promoter dbs

#### Big dbs

• RefSeq Functional Elements promoter features, experimental validation (alpha)

• ENCODE predicted promoters

• Ensembl Regulatory Build promoter features

• Roadmap Epigenomics (some overlap with ENCODE)

• EPDnew - SIB's promoter database, mostly CAGE-based mapping for 5' ends of annotated genes

• FANTOM5 - really a TSS db with promoter extrapolation based on those
